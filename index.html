    <h3 id="headline">I will tell you why I like this film</h3>
    <ul style="list-style: none;">
      <li><strong>Beginning </strong> - both guy and the girl are players. Both find similarities and find themselves liking eachother and wanting to be serious</li>
      <li>
        <strong>halfway</strong> - Everything was great in the beginning then slowly the family , the society , the rules kicks in. so the girls father doesnt like the guy so he marries off his daughter to another guy, our guy takes that as a sign and leave that place and goes into the forest to live like a normal human because what he belives is that if you want something you should get it but he also realises that its not upto him anymore there are too many knots to be untied for that.
      </li>         - 
     <li> 
     <strong>End - </strong>   
     Our guy is happy with the imaginary girl that his mind is showing him . one day the girl returns saying that she divorced and would like to be with him but the guy is already happy since she never left him cause he thought that the imaginary one is the one thats mine since it was with me through all the times so he says iam happy.
      </li>


      <p2> there is this dialogue that i liked very much which happens in the forest area where some village people were offering prayers and our guy was passing by while talking to the imaginary version of his girl so these guys beat him saying why would you do such a thing, our guy says "what i disturped you? i was talking to my imaginary girl and i didnt even notice you guys thats how much i was into it and you guys got disturbed by me i think you should question your system of doing things."</p2>
